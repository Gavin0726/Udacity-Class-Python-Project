# Trivia

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia 
on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game.

The application can:

Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
Delete questions.
Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
Search for questions based on a text query string.
Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

Please go to the Trivia Readme.md to find details.



# Coffee Shop

Udacity has decided to open a new digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. 
But they need help setting up their menu experience.

The application can:

Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.
